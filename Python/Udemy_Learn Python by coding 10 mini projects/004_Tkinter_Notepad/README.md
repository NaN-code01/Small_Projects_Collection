# Tkinter Notepad

A simple **Notepad application** built with Python's `tkinter` library.  
It allows users to write, save, and load `.txt` files with a dark-themed interface.

## Features

- Minimalist text editor built with `tkinter`.  
- Supports **saving** text to `.txt` files.  
- Supports **loading** existing `.txt` files.  
- Dark theme interface for better readability.  
- Window automatically centered on the screen.  
- Error messages and success notifications via message dialogs.

## Notes

- ‼️This code is mostly written in Indonesian (function names, variables, prompts, and comments). Non-Indonesian speakers might need additional effort to read or modify the code.  
- Only `.txt` files are supported.  
- Suitable for small text editing tasks, not a full-featured editor.  

## Requirements
